## Hi, I’m Kedarnath 👋  

I’m an engineering student who enjoys **building systems**, understanding how they behave under real constraints, and improving them through iteration.

Right now, I’m exploring **AI-powered applications**, while grounding myself in strong backend and system fundamentals.

---

### Current Focus
- AI-powered systems using **large language models**
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Evaluating and improving AI output quality
- Designing workflows that handle failure gracefully

This focus may evolve, but my goal remains the same:  
**to grow into a reliable engineer who can work on complex systems.**

---

### Selected Projects (Work in Progress)
- **Document-based Question Answering System**  
  An end-to-end RAG pipeline for querying real-world documents, with attention to design decisions and limitations.

- **LLM Evaluation & Quality Framework**  
  A small framework to assess faithfulness, relevance, and consistency of AI-generated responses.

- **Agentic Workflow System**  
  A controlled multi-step task execution system with guardrails, retries, and state management.

Each project includes documentation explaining *why things are built the way they are*.

### Tech I’ve worked with
**Languages**  
`Python` · `C++`

**Backend & Data**  
`FastAPI` · `REST APIs` · `SQL` · `Vector Databases`

**AI & Systems**  
`LLM APIs` · `Embeddings` · `RAG Pipelines`

**Foundations**  
`Git` · `Linux` · `Basic System Design`

---

### What I’m aiming for
Opportunities where I can:
- Work on real engineering problems  
- Learn from production constraints  
- Gradually take ownership of system design

Thanks for stopping by.
